## Web Starters

> Some startkits for building quick prototypes or websites. Depending on what you want to achieve, a different startkit is needed.


### Startkits
- For quick prototypes and very small websites use the [Small Web Starter](small-web-starter/).
- For larger websites use the [Medium Web Starter](medium-web-starter/).

That's it. Go and create, become a Master Builder.

##### Git Flow
Web Starters works with [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).

For a contribution to Web Starters, you need to follow the [following workflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow#initialization) with the addition of a pull-request.

Example for adding a feature:

- Start from develop (make sure to pull first)
- `git flow feature start -your feature name-`
- `git flow feature publish -your feature name-`
- start making your changes (commit and push regularly)
- when done, make a pull-request from your feature branch to develop
- after the pull-request is accepted, do `git flow feature finish -your feature name-`
